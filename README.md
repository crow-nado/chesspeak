At the moment there is no two player live functionality, so you have to test it by playing against yourself. I have set up a sample game that you can use to avoid having to log in.

If you'd like to test the sign in experience you need to sign up (no email verification used so feel free to use a fake one) and select 'Create A Game'

After that you can name and create a game. You would then want to log out and create a second user with another email. At this point you can select 'Join Game' and you should see the game you had created as the first user. Select 'Join' on this screen to start the game.
